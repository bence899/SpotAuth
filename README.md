### **SpotAuth-Lite: Full Stack Application**

This project is a **full stack web application** that includes both a frontend and backend to validate music uploads before they are added to Spotify's catalog. It demonstrates how Spotify could integrate a service to detect **AI-generated tracks**, **duplicate content**, and **metadata mismatches**. 

Below, I’ll explain how the **frontend and backend work together** and provide a detailed example of how a user interacts with the application.

---

## **Frontend and Backend Workflow**

### **Frontend**
The frontend is built with **React** (or Next.js if SSR is needed) and provides an intuitive user interface (UI) for:
1. **Uploader Login:** Authenticate users via Spotify credentials or mock login.
2. **Metadata Submission:** Allow users to input track metadata like title, artist, duration, and optionally upload an audio file.
3. **Validation Results Display:** Show users whether their track passes the validation checks or if it’s flagged for issues.

### **Backend**
The backend is built with **Node.js and Express.js** and handles:
1. **Authentication:** Mock uploader login or OAuth integration with Spotify.
2. **Metadata Verification:** Validates track metadata against a dummy catalog or Spotify’s Web API.
3. **AI Content Detection:** (Simulated) Detects if the uploaded audio file is AI-generated by checking its properties against mock AI-generated data.
4. **Fraud Detection:** Checks for duplicate tracks in the catalog.

## **Frontend: Example Usage**

### **Step 1: Login**
- **What Happens:**
  - The user clicks a “Login” button and is authenticated using Spotify OAuth or mock credentials.
  - If successful, the user is taken to the upload dashboard.
- **UI Elements:**
  - Login button.
  - Redirect to Spotify login page or simple username/password fields.
- **Example:**
  - User enters `username: uploader1`, `password: key123`, clicks "Login," and is redirected to the dashboard.

---

### **Step 2: Track Metadata Input**
- **What Happens:**
  - The user enters the following details in a form:
    - **Track Title:** "Ocean Waves"
    - **Artist Name:** "DJ Bliss"
    - **Duration:** "3:45"
  - Optionally, the user uploads the audio file of the track (e.g., `ocean_waves.mp3`).
  - The user clicks “Validate Track.”
- **UI Elements:**
  - Form with fields for track metadata.
  - File upload button for audio.
  - Submit button labeled “Validate Track.”
- **Example:**
  - The form inputs are sent to the backend `/verify` endpoint for validation.

---

### **Step 3: Validation Results**
- **What Happens:**
  - The backend responds with the validation result:
    - **Metadata Validation:**
      - If the track exists in the dummy catalog, the response is:  
        *"Track validated successfully!"*  
      - If the metadata does not match:  
        *"Track metadata mismatch detected!"*
    - **AI Content Detection:**
      - If the uploaded audio file is flagged as AI-generated (mocked for demo):  
        *"Track flagged as AI-generated content."*
  - The frontend displays the result in a results card or modal.
- **UI Elements:**
  - Validation results card.
  - Possible actions: Retry validation or upload corrected metadata.
- **Example:**
  - *Validation passed:* "Track validated successfully and ready for upload."
  - *Validation failed:* "Track flagged as AI-generated content. Please revise your submission."

---

### **Step 4: Final Report**
- **What Happens:**
  - If validation passes, the user sees a confirmation message:  
    *“Your track is ready for upload to Spotify’s catalog!”*
  - If validation fails, the user is prompted to correct metadata or upload a new file.
- **UI Elements:**
  - Success confirmation with “Download Report” button.
  - Retry options for failed submissions.
- **Example:**
  - User clicks "Download Report" to receive a detailed JSON report of the validation.

## **Backend: Key Validation Checks**

1. **Metadata Validation**
   - Endpoint: `/verify-metadata`
   - Process:
     - Compare submitted metadata with the dummy catalog or Spotify's catalog via Web API.
     - Check for:
       - Exact matches (to detect duplicates).
       - Mismatches in artist name, title, or duration.
   - Mock Example:
     - Input:
       ```json
       {
         "title": "Ocean Waves",
         "artist": "DJ Bliss",
         "duration": "3:45"
       }
       ```
     - Response (Match Found):
       ```json
       {
         "valid": true,
         "message": "Track validated successfully."
       }
       ```
     - Response (Mismatch):
       ```json
       {
         "valid": false,
         "message": "Track metadata mismatch detected."
       }
       ```

2. **AI Content Detection**
   - Endpoint: `/detect-ai`
   - Process:
     - Analyze uploaded audio (mocked for demo).
     - Check against properties commonly found in AI-generated audio.
   - Mock Example:
     - Input:
       - Uploaded file: `ocean_waves.mp3`.
     - Response (AI Content Detected):
       ```json
       {
         "valid": false,
         "message": "Track flagged as AI-generated content."
       }
       ```
     - Response (No AI Content Detected):
       ```json
       {
         "valid": true,
         "message": "No AI-generated content detected."
       }
       ```

3. **Uploader Authentication**
   - Endpoint: `/auth`
   - Process:
     - Validate uploader credentials (mocked or via Spotify OAuth).
   - Mock Example:
     - Input:
       ```json
       {
         "username": "uploader1",
         "password": "key123"
       }
       ```
     - Response (Valid User):
       ```json
       {
         "authenticated": true,
         "message": "Authentication successful."
       }
       ```
     - Response (Invalid User):
       ```json
       {
         "authenticated": false,
         "message": "Invalid credentials."
       }
       ```

## **Frontend Example Summary**
The web app lets users log in, input track details, validate metadata, and detect AI-generated content. This creates a seamless artist onboarding experience while demonstrating the backend’s functionality.

---

## **Why This Matters**
This project solves critical challenges Spotify faces:
- **AI Content Detection:** Protects the catalog from fraudulent, AI-generated tracks.
- **Metadata Integrity:** Ensures metadata is accurate and prevents duplicates.
- **Seamless Integration:** Demonstrates how this service could integrate into Spotify’s existing upload pipeline.
